This game was made for the course STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING (004) (EE AUTH).
It uses the graphics library raylib.

## How to run

- This game comes precompiled in the folder **_game/exec_**
- It has the raylib library statically linked and can be easily recompiled using the script **_game/compile.bat_**
- You can change anything you want, you could even use this as a starting template by deleting everything **_:)_**

There is also a complete assignment included. It explains the usage of most functions. 
The catch is that it is writen in greek.

Note that this was the first game I created overall so it may not be so well written.
